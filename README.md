# sorting-music

## Background
With nearly 14,000 mp3 files stored in my harddrive, it takes quite a while to load up the folder. I started this project to sort all files to subfolders. 

## Description
Sorts all mp3 files in a single folder to sub-folders according to Artist, Album or Year of release. The mp3 file must be a id3v1 file with all tags in English. Only works in Windows as it utilizes Windows.h.

## Environment
- Visual studios 2017
- Windows 10
